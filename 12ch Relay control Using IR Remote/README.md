# Relay control using IR Remote

To run this sketch you need IRremote Library. 

This library enables you to send and receive using infra-red signals on an Arduino.
Check [here](http://z3t0.github.io/Arduino-IRremote/) for more information.

## IRremote Library Version - 2.1.0
I have used IRremote library Version 2.1.0 is here in [lib](https://github.com/mihir8181/Arduino_geek_projects/tree/master/12ch%20Relay%20control%20Using%20IR%20Remote/Lib) folder.

Navigate to the new [Releases](https://github.com/z3t0/Arduino-IRremote/releases), and installed updated library.

## IRremote Library Installation
1. Navigate to the [Releases](https://github.com/z3t0/Arduino-IRremote/releases) page.
2. Download the latest release.
3. Extract the zip file
4. Move the "IRremote" folder that has been extracted to your libraries directory.
5. Make sure to delete Arduino_Root/libraries/RobotIRremote. Where Arduino_Root refers to the install directory of Arduino. The library RobotIRremote has similar definitions to IRremote and causes errors.
